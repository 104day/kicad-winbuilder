 Version history:

      * Fix rebuild_cache target to keep the version history correct.
        Appears to be a problem with CMake here, having the same target
        file for OUTPUT_FILE and ERROR_FILE makes the target silently
        fail. This should be possible according to the CMake documentation.
        Thanks to m for reporting the bug. Fixes bug 1333243
        
3.4  11.06.2014 - BJS
      * Copy *.kiface files to the kicad/bin directory. Fixes bug 1315945
      * Fix issue with checking for wxPython (was checking for 2.94 binary)
      * start kicad.exe instead of running it from RunKiCad.bat so that the
        console window is dropped (Thanks to Ian Woloschin). Fixes
        bug 1320512
      * Use tee to be able to view progress of KiCad build instead of having
        a static display (Thanks to Ian Woloschin). Fixes bug 1327263
      * Install xsltproc so that the xsl templates can be used. (Thanks to
        Peter Ogden). Fixes bug 1328339
      * Install missing kicad.pro and other template files from the kicad
        source code (Thanks to Ed Johns). Fixes bug 1276387
      * Issue a warning when the installed path length may be too long to
        build KiCad successfully. Fixes bug 1267057
      * Fix issue with finding local (up-to-date) documentation because the
        env var KICAD was incorrectly set (Thanks to Peter Ogden)

3.3  10.01.2014 - BJS
      * Fix move of kicad-library to github
      * Remove now unneeded FPLIBTABLE as this is now ON by default
      * Bumped wxPython to V3.0.0 with a couple of pathches to suit KiCad
      * Added setting %USERPROFILE% so fp-lib-table is local
      * All example fp-lib-tables are in the kicad/share/template directory
      * Fix build issue regarding freeroute exchange html header file

3.2   15.11.2013 - BJS
      * KiCad Introduces BZIP2 dependancy, so BZIP2 is downloaded, patched
        and built. Fixes Bug #1251717 reported by Ferdinand Keil
      * The CHANGELOG was too long in the cmake script. So it's been ripped
        out to CHANGELOG

3.1   08.11.2013 - BJS
      * Remove OpenSSL from build environment in anticipation of it being
        built as part of KiCad instead using the OpenSSL-CMake project
      * Change the GLEW compilation command to prevent a large amount of
        errors and display when building GLEW
      * Default parallel processing to ON, but prevent it being used until
        the KiCad source tree has had the *_keywords.cpp files generated so
        as not to cause build errors by these files being corrupted when
        generated during a parallel build process

      31.10.2013 - Orson
      * Merged all the recent changes and modified the script to work with the
        master branch, as it already includes CERN code

      09.09.13 - BJS
      * Copy /src/doc/internat folder for internationalisation strings when
        making a local copy of KiCad. Fixes bug 1222480 reported by Kerusey
        Karyu
      * Made the parallel build option default OFF. This prevents some build
        errors, especially on initial builds. There is a concurrency problem
        when generating the keyword parser files resulting in corrupt source
        files
      * Default FPLIBTABLE to ON to provide the new footprint library table
        support
      * Add new GITHUB_PLUGIN support
      * Default GITHUB_PLUGIN to ON to provide Github footprint library
        connectivity
      * Add OpenSSL library copying
      * Swap to mingw-w64 to use sjlj exceptions to allow cross-DLL boundary
        exception throwing
      * Swap wxPython build to suit the new exception model

3.0   13.10.13 - Orson
      * GLEW is built using Brian's glew-cmake, instead of being downloaded
        as binary

      27.09.13 - Orson
      * Changed the repository address

      07.09.13 - BJS
      * Fixed PATH problem to enable successful loading of _stc.pyd for
        pycrust python console in PCBNEW
      * Fixed Python API dependancy fix for PCBNEW. Simply delete the
        generated files to force them to get re-generated before each build

      12.08.13 - BJS
      * Scrubbed stacked branch due to the revision not being accurate
        anymore. Instead moved back to a checkout, but included the
        lightweight option
      * Changed Bazaar checkout to a stacked branch so that the checkout is
        lighter. This speeds up the new build process significantly, and is
        useful for all other checkouts too (as now there is a checkout of the
        documentation too
      * Added latest KiCad documentation to the install
      * Added latest KiCad library to the install

      09.08.13 - Orson
      * Modified the script to work with the GAL branch

      07.08.13 - BJS
      * BUGFIX: Fixed build so it generates the scripting build again! CMake
        options where being malformed by using quotes. So a single argument
        was being passed instead of the full list of arguments

      06.08.13 - BJS
      * Added ability to check for a later version release. This way we'll be
        able to inform the user that there is a new version available
      * Added parallel build option so people can select whether to have high
        CPU usage or not

      05.08.13 - BJS
      * Added easy to use options SCRIPTING and FPLIBTABLE to tune the KiCad
        build
      * Added debug version of wxWidgets-cmake for debug build
      * Use ProcessorCount - 1 as the number of parallel compilation jobs
      * Fixed environment build script which had an escape left over from my
        system. CHECK DIFF BEFORE COMMIT!
      * Added new release of wxWidgets-cmake which fixes an issue with the
        STC library and therefore fixes a problem with PyCrust hanging in
        PCBNEW when it gains focus. The scripting build now looks to be
        complete

      03.08.13 - BJS
      * Binaries now release for the wxWidgets-cmake project. Updated URL
        and MD5 accordingly
      * Fixed several file copy operations which failed to "install" KiCad
        with scripting in the /bin directory

      28.07.13 - BJS
      * Instead of building wxPython, a binary from the wxPython-CMake
        project is used. This build also includes wxPython so that KiCad's
        python bindings can be build
      * Python-a-mingw-us is included in the environment

2.1   07.06.13 - BJS
      * Fixed bug 1186954 Reported by Kerusey Karyu. Windows UAC preventing
        GNUWin32 patch program to execute because of requiring admin
        priveleges to run any program that matches the simple search pattern
        *patch*.exe - fixed with a manifest

2.0   02.06.13 - BJS
      * Updated the Bazaar installation to include the bzrtools plugins as
        bzr patch is a requirement of the KiCad build now

1.0   04.01.13 - BJS
      * Added built-in build environment ready for a first binary release

      * Added check to see if source if already up-to-date. If it is then
        don't update the code or rebuild the codebase. Fixes bug #1065553

0.9   03.01.13 - BJS
      * Added SHELL=CMD to wxPython build line to prevent sh from MSYS or
        WinAVR from preventing wxPython to build. As Cmake fails too, the
        script checks for sh and returns with a graceful error message if it
        is present in the environment path. Fixes bug #979001 #979002

      * Added cmd /c to bzr commands so that cmake can execute bzr batch files
        which is necessary when bzr is installed as python.
        Fixes bug #1081915

      * Checked code surrounding removal of dead archives, it works. However
        cmake does not barf on 0 length .tar.bz2 archive so incorrect download
        needs to be detected seperately. This is a bug in cmake.
        Fixes bug #1083292

0.8   03.08.12 - BJS
      * Decreased the number of jobs to decrease the memory overhead required
        to build KiCad. With -j over 4Gb is required otherwise, even for a
        release build

      02.08.12 - BJS
      * Pumped wxPython to 2.9.4 because MinGW 4.7.0 (now installed as
        default by mingw-get) fails to build 2.9.2
      * Sped up compilation by including the -j flag on the KiCad build. It
        cannot be added to the wxPython build as this fails several times
        before setup.h is created

0.7   13.04.12 - BJS
      * Fixed version string information using 'make rebuild_cache'

      03.02.11 - BJS
      * Fix for MinGW-get URL from Sourceforge. Fixes bug #909809 reported by
        Ian Woloschin
      * Fix to fix the file structure if wxPython failed to download. Fixes
        bug #892467 reported by Krzysztof Wesolowski

      11.08.11 - BJS
      * Added pcb_calculator.exe to the executable list to be copied to the
        bin directory. Fixes bug #823159

0.6   04.08.11 - BJS
      * Pumped wxPython to 2.9.2 - no need to patch for localisation bug
      * Changed cmake requirement from 2.6.4 to 2.8.2 due to requiring bz2
        support in CPack
      * Default optimisation level set to -O2
      * Upon successful build, binaries and MinGW dependancies are copied to
        the /bin directory so that they can be run in-place without having to
        be installed

0.5   01.08.11 - BJS
      * Fixed broken MinGW installer download link. Hopefully they will move
        to a stable version soon
      * Added a newline to the "Configuring KiCad ..." messages as bzr doesn't
        insert a newline after a checkout, and it uses \r to keep progress on
        the current line
      * Fixed spelling mistake in mingw stderr log file
      * Added an error message if the script fails to build KiCad instead of
        silently finishing without building
      * Fixed if/endif mismatch in wxWidget build block

0.4   01.07.11 - BJS
      * Simplified the way Bazaar is used and instead of branching lp:kicad
        only checkout lp:kicad and then update.
      * This script must be run without the source code being already branched
        otherwise the update will always pass as the source is a branch and
        not a checkout of the remote head

      28.06.11 - BJS
      * Fixed bug in wxPython build check. Should be ${nnn} instead of nnn
      * Command line settings do not appear to propogate, so build is Release
        by default, but can still be selected as Debug by changing the setting
        in the script
      * Added tree revert before merging as an option. This is the default
        behaviour and now merging is an option as the target audience for this
        script should really use it with vanilla sources. Changes to the
        source should be at developer level who should be able to put together
        a development environment, or at least be able to use bazaar manually
      * Fixed variable expansion bugs in Bazaar merging logic
      * Got rid of needless debug message

      23.06.11 - BJS
      * Fixed bug when updating source code - bzr stdout redirected to
        variable, but bzr also asks for credentials sometimes; hence stdout
        should not be redirected
      * Added check for bzr credentials with "bzr whoami". This needs to be
        done on a fresh bzr install
      * Fixed a bug in the bzr update logic. It is essential to merge AND
        commit, otherwise the second merge will fail with an uncommitted
        changes error from bzr
      * Fixed the error checking for wxPython source code
      * Compile only release or debug version of wxPython depending on which
        version of KiCad is being targetted

0.3   15.06.11 - BJS
      * Fixed bug with updating source code - from bzr up to bzr merge
      * Added several failure points, along with useful messages to inform the
        user of why the script (or external) failed
      * Moved wx source code to the src directory!

0.2   13.06.11 - BJS
      * Added variables for all directories

      08.06.11 - BJS
      * Correctly detect previously installed gcc compiler
      * Simplified wxPython installation check by removing the check for a
        system install. Instead, only the KiCad install is supported
      * Added revision number printing so that it is easy to tell what
        revision is being built
      * Fixed configuring KiCad, no longer configures the project if it is not
        needed

0.1
      03.06.11 - BJS
      * Tidied up the script, added more useful comments
      * First complete script capable of building KiCad
